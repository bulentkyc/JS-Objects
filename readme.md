Objects in JS is a huge and important subject. I explained in 2 steps. 
On the first step explained basics and end of the subject gave some repeat tasks.
You can find this on #objects-1 folder.
    
On second step, I completed subject and gave a final project for object.
You can find subject part on #objects-2 folder.
    
As a final project I made an email application. Application has 2 different views. 
   1st: Compose
   2nd: Inbox
App uses objects to store emails and show. Also with this sample you will recap, functions and datatypes too.
